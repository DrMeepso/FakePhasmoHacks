# FakePhasmoHacks

Put the Cheats.bat & BLT.dll into the same folder as Phasmophobia.exe
once you've done that run phasmophobia then Cheats.exe, then sit back and relax as who ever ran it gets "Banned"

If you want to "Unban" Someone or Undo the effects of the "Cheats" Put Cheats.bat in the Phasmophobia folder 
Then make a new file called "yourmum.fat" then run cheats.bat and your game will be back to normal

BLT.dll is a renamed .bat file you can open it in a text editor and edit it
